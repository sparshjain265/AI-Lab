Logic: (curse.py)
Run the random agent for dimensions 1 to maxDim for 10 cases and take average number of steps
Plot the graph and we can see the curse of dimensionality

On running for max dim = 10, and L = 3, the output is attached

dim.py is was an older attempt at the quesion with different classes for different dimensions. switched to curse for a more general approach!
