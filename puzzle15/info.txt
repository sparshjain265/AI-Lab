A sample input and sample output has been attached

Logic:
A simple BFS is used to find the optimal path to the goal state (if exists, checked using parity)
Visited list is not used to time complexity is not the best
To find the path, we know that from each node there are exactly 4 children and we also know that we exit the tree when we reach the goal state with the best path
Hence, numbering the nodes (starting from 1) in level order, we can find the path by which we came
To achieve this fully filled search tree, we inserted False in the tree for illegal moves
